<i>We use cookies and similar tools across our websites to improve their
performance and enhance your user experience. This policy explains how
we do that.
</br></br>
What are cookies?
</br>
Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer
or mobile device when you first visit a site or page. The cookie will
help the website, or another website, to recognise your device the
next time you visit. Web beacons or other similar files can also do
the same thing. We use the term "cookies" in this policy to refer to
all files that collect information in this way.

There are many functions cookies serve. For example, they can help us
to remember your username and preferences, analyse how well our
website is performing, or even allow us to recommend content we
believe will be most relevant to you.

Certain cookies contain personal information - for example, if you
click to "remember me" when logging in, a cookie will store your
username. Most cookies won't collect information that identifies you,
and will instead collect more general information such as how users
arrive at and use our websites, or a user's general location.
</br></br>
What sort of cookies does the FT use?

Generally, our cookies perform up to four different functions:
</br></br>
1. Essential cookies
</br>
Some cookies are essential for the operation of our website. For
example, some cookies allow us to identify subscribers and ensure they
can access the subscription only pages. If a subscriber opts to
disable these cookies, the user will not be able to access all of the
content that a subscription entitles them to.
</br></br>
2. Performance Cookies
</br>
We utilise other cookies to analyse how our visitors use our websites
and to monitor website performance. This allows us to provide a high
quality experience by customising our offering and quickly identifying
and fixing any issues that arise. For example, we might use
performance cookies to keep track of which pages are most popular,
which method of linking between pages is most effective, and to
determine why some pages are receiving error messages. We might also
use these cookies to highlight articles or site services that we think
will be of interest to you based on your usage of the website.
</br></br>
3. Functionality Cookies
</br>
We use functionality cookies to allow us to remember your preferences.
For example, cookies save you the trouble of typing in your username
every time you access the site, and recall your customisation
preferences, such as which regional edition of the website you want to
see when you log in.
</br>
We also use functionality cookies to provide you with enhanced
services such as allowing you to watch a video online or comment on a
blog.
</br></br>
4. Behaviourally Targeted Advertising Cookies
</br>
The FT and our advertisers use cookies to serve you with
advertisements that we believe are relevant to you and your interests.
For example, if you read a number of articles on motoring on FT.com or
on other sites, a car manufacturer might infer you are interested in
this topic and serve you with its car advertisements. You might see
these advertisements on FT.com and on other sites that you visit.
However, we do not tell our advertisers who you are.
</br></br>
Does anyone else use cookies on FT websites?
</br>
Advertisers sometimes use their own cookies to provide you with
targeted advertising. For example, advertisers may use a profile they
have built on sites that you have previously visited to present you
with more relevant advertisements during your visit to FT.com. We
believe that it is useful to our users to see advertisements that are
more relevant to their interests. If you are based in the European
Union and would like to learn more about how advertisers use these
types of cookies or to choose not to receive them, please visit
www.youronlinechoices.eu. If you are based in the United States and
would like to learn more, please visit
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.

We also use or allow third parties to serve cookies that fall into the
four categories above. For example, like many companies, we use Google
Analytics to help us monitor our website traffic. We may also use
third party cookies to help us with market research, revenue tracking,
improving site functionality and monitoring compliance with our terms
and conditions and copyright policy.
</br></br>
Can a website user block cookies?
</br>
As we've explained above, cookies help you to get the most out of our websites.

The first time you accessed our website after 22 May 2012, you should
have seen an overlay which explained that by continuing to access our
site, you are consenting to our use of cookies.

However, if you do wish to disable our cookies then please follow the
instructions <a href="disablecookies.html">here</a>

Please remember that if you do choose to disable cookies, you may find
that certain sections of our website do not work properly
</br></br>
Do we track whether users open our emails?
</br>
Our emails may contain a single, campaign-unique "web beacon pixel" to
tell us whether our emails are opened and verify any clicks through to
links or advertisements within the email. We may use this information
for purposes including determining which of our emails are more
interesting to users, to query whether users who do not open our
emails wish to continue receiving them and to inform our advertisers
in aggregate how many users have clicked on their advertisements. The
pixel will be deleted when you delete the email. If you do not wish
the pixel to be downloaded to your device, you should select to
receive emails from us in plain text rather than HTML.
</br></br>
