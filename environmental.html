Reviewed and updated 6th September 2018 Industrial Computer Contracts (West Midlands) - Director<br>
We were unsuccessful in our objective for 2016 and due to the loss of a key supplier and other time consuming difficulties so we did not review and report on this policy in 2017.<br>
Next year we will target the use of Fairtrade goods<br>
Reviewed and updated 29th November 2020 during the coronavirus lockdown Industrial Computer Contracts (West Midlands)<br>
We explored the use of Fairphone but found that it was not a viable pathway. We currently use Samsung Galaxy S5 until the end of their useful life.<br>
Next year we will target the planting of trees to combat global warming.<br>
