My old GeoCities Homestead was http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Campus/2735
<br/>
<br/>I have looked in the Wayback Machine and various GeoCities archives but with very limited success.
<br/>I have a backup of my site after it was moved to Yahoo!. <a href="gcindex.html">This</a> gives you a flavour but it is not the same.

GeoCities was started during November 1994 by David Bohnett and John Rezner, 
and was named Beverly Hills Internet briefly before being renamed GeoCities. 
On January 28, 1999, it was acquired by Yahoo!, 
at which time it was allegedly the third-most visited website on the World Wide Web. (Wikipedia)
