Working for <a href="https://www.aone.uk.com/">Aone+, the Area 7 MAC, for the Highways Agency</a> I was responsible for the maintenance and development of the MS Access database which managed the overall programme of engineering works for the area valued at approximately 60M in 2014. The database held the dates of works for the constantly changing programme and, at a summary level, the operational financial plan for the organisation.
<br/><br/>
The technical environment was Windows XP and Windows 7 with Office 2007 running both on desktops and under Citrix. A feature of the Citrix environment was that it was used without authentication passthru which led to some challenges when identifying users and managing access levels for the management plan.
