Microsoft Access support and programming for your business, when you need it. 
Cost effective help on an hourly basis. On site in the Midlands. 
I have been providing advanced programming and development as a <a href="cv.html">freelance consultant for over 20 years</a>. 
With that comes a lot of experience, experience that I can leverage to help you and your business when needed.
<br/><br/>
<img src="access.png" height="30" width="30"><i><b> Access programming</b></i>
<br/>Do you need help with an existing Access database that was written by an employee who has left? 
Do you have an idea for a new Access database that would streamline your business? That is what I do. 
Access reports, forms, tables, queries, macros, VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) programming, personalised training, help, and support when you need it.
<br/><br/>
<img src="excel.png"><i><b>Excel support</b></i>
<br/>Do you need help with a single formula, a pivot table, an advanced chart, drop-down lists, userforms, a macro, automation, conditional formatting, report design, 
linking workbooks, automatic loading of text files, live database or web links or anything else in Excel?  If so, that is what I do.
<br/><br/>
<img src="nhscoronavirus2.png" alt="coronavirus" title="coronavirus" width="30"><i><b>Fully remote support</b></i>
<br/>Since the pandemic I am available to work "fully remote". 
Fully remote means using Microsoft Remote Desktop to log on to your network via a gateway computer and a network account with user level permissions.
<br/><br/>
<img src="hmrc.png" alt="HMRC" title="HMRC" width="30"><i><b> IR35 changes</b></i>
<br/>Since the law was changed I am now in search of Fixed Term PAYE contracts.
My limited company Industrial Computer Contracts (West Midlands) Ltd is closing after 38 years.
