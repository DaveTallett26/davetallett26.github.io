<br/>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR THE SUPPLY OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES</div>
<div class="style84">
<br/>
<p>     <h4>Fee Rates and Hours of Work</h4>
<p>
     Industrial Computer Contracts (West Midlands) Limited (ICC) staff provide services to the customer on a daily
basis,
     charged at the fee rates quoted in the Contract Letter. Fractions
of a
     day are charged on a pro rata basis.
<P>
     Fee rates exclude VAT which will (where appropriate) be added to
the
     amount of an invoice at the prevailing rate.
<P>
     The fee rates quoted will be fixed for the initial period of the
     assignment, or for 3 months, whichever is the shorter. Charge
rates
     will be assessed from time to time.

 <P>    Fees exclude travel or subsistence expenses and the costs of
materials
     and services not provided directly by ICC, unless stated
     otherwise on the contract letter. Any expenses necessarily incurred
in
     execution of the assignment will be charged at cost.

 <P>    During site work, travelling time in excess of normal travel to
work
     time will be charged at cost; where applicable the cost of air
travel,
     rail travel or a car mileage allowance at the prevailing company
rate
     will be charged.

  <P>   During site work involving overnight stays the cost of bed,
breakfast
     and evening meal, any incidental expenses such as travel and
medical
     insurance (outside UK only), plus the cost of ICC's standard
     employee disturbance allowance will be charged.

<P>     Assignments will be full time unless otherwise specified. The
standard
     working day is seven hours between 8am and 8pm,
Monday
     to Friday. Any additional time worked within these hours will be
     charged pro-rata. This may be subject to alteration by mutual
     agreement for work carried out on customer premises.

 <P>    Hours worked outside the normal working day are charged at time and
a
     half. Work undertaken during week-ends, or public holidays is
charged
     at double time. Premium rate charges may be subject to alteration
by
     mutual agreement.

 <P>    Charges will not be made for complete days during the assignment
which
     are not spent directly on the assignment such as public and annual
     holidays, sickness, and temporary absence for any other reason.
 <P>    <h4>Payment</h4>

  <P>   Invoices are submitted for work undertaken in the previous calendar
     month. They are accompanied by (and based on) time sheets completed
by
     staff on the assignment, countersigned by the customer's
     representative. ICC reserves the right to submit time sheets
     which have not been countersigned if the customer withholds
     authorisation unreasonably. Invoices must be paid in full within 7
     days of the date of issue.

  <P>   ICC may at its discretion charge interest at 2 per cent
per
     annum above Barclays Bank base rate on any sum not paid on the
due
     date. Such interest shall run from day to day and accrue after as
well
     as before any judgement and shall from time to time be compounded
     monthly on the amount overdue until payment thereof.

  <P>   If any payment becomes overdue, ICC may (without prejudice
to
     its other rights or remedies) suspend work under the contract until
     payment in full thereof has been made.

 <P>    The Customer shall not be entitled to withhold payment in whole or
in
     part on the ground that it has a claim, counterclaim or set-off
     against ICC.


<!-- <h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2> -->
 <P>    <h4 id="ipr">Intellectual Property Rights and Ownership</h4>

 <P>    Ownership and Intellectual Property Rights to the results of the
work
     undertaken by ICC for this assignment shall at all times
vest
     with the customer. Information provided by the customer relating to
     the assignment will be treated as confidential unless specific
     authorisation to release it is given by the customer or the
     information comes into the public domain. ICC will ensure
that
     its employees and sub-contractors are bound by provisions similar
to
     those contained herein. This clause shall survive termination of
this
     assignment for a period of two years.

   <P>  The provisions of the above IPR clause shall not apply to any programming
tools
     or techniques of a general nature acquired or used by ICC
     (Background IPR) in the performance of the contract. Such
Background
     IPR will remain the property of ICC, and ICC may
     continue to use the same in any way it thinks fit. This shall
include
     (but not be limited to) development using the same software
languages,
     operating systems, development tools, API's, third party libraries
and
     products.

   <P>  The provisions of the above IPR clause shall not apply to any software
libraries
     or components owned by ICC that are used in the assignment.
     Ownership and Intellectual property rights for such libraries or
     components shall remain with ICC, and the customer shall
     receive an unrestricted license to use, modify and distribute these
     items.
 <P>    <h4>Liability</h4>

  <P>   ICC will undertake the assignment with reasonable care and
     skill, but shall not under any circumstances in relation to its
     undertaking the assignment be liable (in contract, tort or
otherwise)
     for any loss or damage of whatsoever nature (including indirect or
     consequential loss or damage) suffered by the customer whether
arising
     from any act, default or neglect on the part of ICC, its
     employees, agents or sub-contractors or otherwise howsoever, to the
     extent that the amount of such loss or damage exceeds 250,000GBP
(two
     hundred and fifty thousand pounds) for any one occurrence or
series
     of occurrences arising from the same cause.

 <P>    ICC shall not in any event be liable for any indirect or
     consequential loss.

 <P>    The customer agrees to indemnify ICC fully and promptly
against
     all costs, claims, demands, damages and expenses to which
ICC
     may become liable or which ICC may suffer or incur as a
result
     directly or indirectly of ICC's acting in accordance with
the
     customer's instructions, or arising from any act, default or
neglect
     on the part of the customer, its employees, agents or
subcontractors.

   <P>  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, however, nothing in these
     terms and conditions shall operate to exclude or restrict
ICC's
     liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence
     within the meaning of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.
  <P>   <h4>Transfer of Staff</h4>

   <P>  Except as provided later in this provision, otherwise than by
written
     agreement with each other neither party will, during the term of
this
     Agreement and for a period of 6 months after the termination of
this
     Agreement, intentionally make or seek to make any offer of
employment
     or other contract for services, whether directly or indirectly, to
any
     of the other party's employees or individual contractor suppliers
     involved in the performance of work under or pursuant to this
     Agreement or with whom they have become acquainted as a result of
this
     Agreement. In the event that either party breaches this provision
it
     will be contractually bound to pay the other party the greater of
3
     times the person's annual salary inclusive of all benefits at time
of
     their resignation or departure or 3 times the new annual salary
or
     fee inclusive of alt benefits, such being deemed by both parties to
     this Agreement to be fair compensation for such loss. This
provision
     shall not apply in respect of any individual who ceased to work for
     the affected party at least 6 months prior to any approach, nor
to
     any individual who can be proved to have responded to a bona fide
     published recruitment advertisement where the recruited person is
not
     recruited to work for or with a party's personnel or department
     involved in this agreement. In addition, where the party wishing to
     approach the employee or contractor concerned informs the other
party
     to this Agreement then that other party may either refuse or give
such
     consent, and either waive its right to compensation or seek the
full
     or any alternative amount as compensation for its loss. Nothing in
     this clause is intended to prevent the right of any individual to
seek
     employment with whomsoever they wish, but this clause is intended
to
     provide for due compensation where such a situation occurs as a
result
     of entering this Agreement, recognising that loss of experienced
     personnel can have a serious effect on any employer.
 <P>    <h4>Cancellation</h4>

  <P>   If no end date for the assignment has been specified, or if either
the
     customer or ICC wishes to terminate an assignment
prematurely,
     the terminating party shall give 4 (four) weeks written notice to
     the other.
<P>
     <h4>Substitution of Staff</h4>
<P>
     Whilst all reasonable efforts will be made to use the nominated
staff
     on the assignment, ICC reserves the right to replace any
     nominated staff if it becomes necessary or expedient so to do. If
any
     staff are to be replaced, ICC will give to the customer as
much
     advance notice as the circumstances permit.
  <P>   <h4>Holidays</h4>

 <P>    Holidays taken by staff during the assignment will be those
normally
     applicable to the assigned staff. Authorisation for the taking of
such
     holidays will not be unreasonably withheld by the customer.
     Additionally, the customer agrees to release ICC staff on
     reasonable notice for up to one day per month, on average, for
     training and company matters.
  <P>   <h4>Termination</h4>

   <P>  The assignment may be terminated by either party by notice in
writing
     to the other having immediate effect if either


     the other commits any breach of these Terms together with those in
the
     Contract Letter which breach (if capable of remedy) is not remedied
     within 14 days of notification, or

     the other has a receiver or administrative receiver appointed over
it
     or any part of its undertaking or assets, or passes a resolution
for
     winding up (otherwise than for the purpose of a genuine scheme of
     solvent reconstruction or amalgamation), or a court of competent
     jurisdiction makes an order to that effect or if the other party
     becomes subject to an administration order or enters into voluntary
     arrangement with its creditors or ceases or threatens to cease to
     carry on business.


   <P>  Termination of the assignment shall be without prejudice to the
     parties' rights accrued prior to termination. Nothing shall
prejudice
     the right of either party to recover any amount outstanding
(whether
     already invoiced or not) at the termination.
  <P>   <h4>Exclusions</h4>

  <P>   Except as expressly provided in this Agreement no warranty,
condition,
     undertaking or term, express or implied, statutory or otherwise as
to
     the condition, quality, performance, merchantability or fitness for
     purpose of the Sale provided hereunder is given or assumed by
     ICC, and except as expressly provided in this Agreement all
     such warranties, conditions, undertaking and terms are hereby
     excluded.
   <P>  <h4>Force Majeure</h4>

 <P>    If either party's due performance of the assignment is affected by
any
     accident, event, omission or other matter beyond the party's
     reasonable control, he shall give prompt notice thereof to the
other
     party and shall be under no liability for any injury, loss, damage
or
     expense (direct or consequential) suffered by the other party due
to
     the affected performance. Such party shall use reasonable efforts
to
     avoid or overcome the causes affecting performance and shall fulfil
     outstanding performance when practical so to do.
  <P>   <h4>Notices</h4>

 <P>    Notices relating to the contract shall be in writing, and be sent
by
     first-class letter or facsimile or delivered by hand to ICC
or
     the customer at their normal working address, or at such other
address
     as each party may from time to time designate. Proof that an
envelope
     containing a notice was correctly addressed, prepaid and posted,
shall
     be proof that it was sent.
  <P>   <h4>Waiver</h4>

  <P>   Should either party fail to enforce any provision of the contract
at
     any time, this shall not affect its right thereafter to require
     complete performance by the other party. Waiver of a breach of any
     provision shall not be taken to be a waiver of any subsequent
breach
     or of the provision itself. Any waiver will be ineffective unless
     given in writing.
  <P>  <h4>Dispute</h4>

  <P>   Any dispute arising in connection with the contract between the
     parties shall, after written notice by either party to the other,
be
     referred to a single arbitrator mutually agreed for the purpose, or
in
     default of such agreement, to be appointed at the request of either
     party by the President of the British Computer Society.
   <P>  <h4>Severability</h4>

  <P>   In the event of any clause contained in these Terms and Conditions
or
     in the Contract Letter being declared by any court of competent
     jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or
     unenforceability shall in no way impair or affect any other clause
all
     of which shall remain in full force and effect.
  <P>   <h4>Whole Agreement</h4>

<P>     These Terms and Conditions together with those in the Contract
Letter
     shall apply to any contract for the provision by ICC to the
     customer of professional services and constitutes the entire contract
     between ICC and the customer and supersedes all previous
     communications, representations and contracts either written or
oral.
<P>The customer acknowledges that it is not
     entering into the contract in reliance upon any representation not
set
     out in the contract. No amendment to the contract shall be binding
     unless in writing, signed by the parties or their duly authorised
     representatives and expressed to be for the purpose of such
amendment.
   <P>  <h4>Governing Law</h4>
