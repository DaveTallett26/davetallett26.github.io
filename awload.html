' The Road-550-W from Adventure Works Cycles is everything it s advertised to be.
' Finally, a quality bike that is actually built for a woman and provides control and comfort in one neat package.
' The top tube is shorter, the suspension is weight-tuned and there s a much shorter reach to the brake levers.
' All this adds up to a great mountain bike that is sure to accommodate any woman s anatomy.
' In addition to getting the size right, the saddle is incredibly comfortable.
' Attention to detail is apparent in every aspect from the frame finish to the careful design of each component.
' Each component is a solid performer without any fluff.
' The designers clearly did their homework and thought about size, weight, and funtionality throughout.
' And at less than 19 pounds, the bike is manageable for even the most petite cyclist.
