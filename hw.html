I was hoping to get into programming on the iPhone and bought myself an Apple MacBook for few hundred quid which is probaby the most I have ever paid for a computer 
  (the first was an Amstrad so you can see the circles I move in!) 
  Anyway I waited for one to come up on Amazon Warehouse deals for a few months and thankfully it was a reasonably good one - so not obsolete just yet.
<br/><br/>
I thought I would write a Hello World program for it and there are a few more languages available for the MacBook than I had heard of so it became a work in its own right.

First of all there is Automator - Wikipedia says - "Automator is an application developed by Apple for OS X that implements point-and-click or drag and drop creation of workflows for automating repetitive tasks"

Perl is a widely used programming language developed by Larry Wall in the late 1980's. Since being originally written as a scripting language to assist in system administration tasks, it has taken off as a popular language for doing everything from low-level systems programming to website scripting. If you have ever thought about getting into programming on your Mac, Perl is a great place to start!

<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24092254/can-i-use-xcode-as-an-ide-for-perl-scripts">This link</a> says that you can use Xcode as an IDE for perl on the Mac although it did not work for me. Watch this space as I may return to this later.

Actually this is one of the smoothest languages to get downloaded and working with two very functional <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr04/cos126/hello/mac.html">editors</a>. Unfortunately Apple have just (Jan 2015 OS X Yosemite) dropped it from support by the OS X app store because of the overhead of getting a Java VM of the right version in place to support any programs you may write.
