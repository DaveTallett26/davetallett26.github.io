In June 2015 I carried out a trial intended as a preliminary for the conversion of an old quotation system written in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_%28programming_language%29">Borland Delphi</a> (dating back to the birth of the internet and Windows 3.1 in 1995) The trial was to assess whether the Microsoft Access 2013 and the Runtime Only version would run in the TSC environment consisting of Windows XP, Windows 7 and possibly Windows 10 alongside Office versions Office 2003, Office 2007 and Office 2013. Issues such as 32 bit versus 64 bit hardware were assessed as was the possibility of using the legacy database using Borland Data Engine.
