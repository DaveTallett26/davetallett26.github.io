From January to May 2011 I supported an existing CRM system originally written in Access 2003 for Clive Durose Woodturners of Stoke, a bespoke staircase manufacturer. This involved intricate screens and several linked Access databases including Sage accounts which fed financial information to classify customers for sales reports. This involved programming in VBA and Excel reporting from the Sage accounts system. All three current operating systems were involved - Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7, along with Access 2003, 2007 and 2010 Runtime Only. 32 and 64 bit machines running Windows 7 were also in use simultaneously.
