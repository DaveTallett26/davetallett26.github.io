The project known as Desktop Refresh involved converting a 150 user network of 20 to 30 Access 2002 databases with extensive Access Security to Access 2010 Run Time Only running under Citrix and Windows 7. The main part of the task consisted of merging the user logon procedures of the front end databases into a single login table then supporting users testing the new systems. To give an example of the scale of some of the systems one database system, known affectionately as DADI, is a web of front end and back end databases covering three sites - 14 MDBs at Tunbridge Wells, 7 at Leeds and 7 at Glasgow which are all linked to each other. There were 477 objects (tables, queries, forms, reports, macros and modules) in the largest Tunbridge Wells DADI database.
