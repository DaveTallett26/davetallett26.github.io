I was contracted by Libra Europe, a management consultancy specialising in business change in the FMCG and food sector, who were in the process of supporting a programme of cultural change at Blueberry Foods to meet Tesco standards. Tesco had recently been taken on as a key new customer. I provided assistance with the production plans for the various manufacturing processes which were produced in Excel. In fact the Excel reports were fed data from primarily a complex Access database which in turn took its base data from a central IBM system. The main Excel reports selected parts of the main production plan and generated a sequence for each item of manufacturing equiment. The quality standards for the business were also produced in Excel.
