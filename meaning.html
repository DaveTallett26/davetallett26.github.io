<p>Tallett is an unusual name, where did it come from? </P><P>My best guess is that it originated somewhere in the West of England. 
If you look up the word in some dictionaries the word tallett is an old English word meaning &quot;hayloft&quot; or barn. 
There is a <a href=206.html>house</a> in Marwood, Devon called &quot;The Tallett&quot; which is presumably a barn conversion. 
It was recently advertised for sale on the Internet. 
<a href="http://blogs.ancestry.co.uk/cm/there-are-7-types-of-english-surnames-which-one-is-yours/">English surnames</a> often originated as names of places for example, 
<a href="https://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> may have originated from Lincoln. If there had been more than one Abraham in the village then it 
would be &quot;Abraham who lives by the hayloft&quot; eventually shortened to Abraham Tallett. </P>
I found this on <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/">Family Search</a> round about GXJS-6CP, William Tallett, 1755-1827, Marriage: 2 July 1780, Newnham, Northamptonshire, England.

1 English: nickname; either a term of abuse, from Middle English tailarde ‘someone who has a tail’ (the devil?), or from Old French taillard, a sword for cutting (especially in fencing). For -et and -ot as a late development of -ard, compare Pickett .
<br/><br/>
2 English: relationship name, possibly from an unrecorded Old French personal name * Talot, * Talet, a diminutive form of Continental Germanic * Talo. Compare Tallon .
