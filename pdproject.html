Working for the market leader in the field of online and print commercial developer directories, I worked on the maintenance of Access and Excel based IT systems. The systems have been developed over a number of years and now comprise several Microsoft Access based directory systems which require intricate programming to produce complex and professionally formatted Excel and PDF reports. In most cases the Excel reports required formatting using Excel VBA to produce a professional finish suitable for presentation to the customer. I delivered a number of outstanding programming requirements and added a new directory title. The software used was Windows XP, Access 97 and 2003 with VBA coding in both Access and Excel.
