<div class="style84">
<br/><br/>
The Bribery Act 2010 came into force on 1 July 2011 and it is our policy to conduct all of our business in an honest and ethical manner. We take a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption and are committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all our dealings wherever we operate. We are also committed to implementing and enforcing effective systems to counter bribery.
<br/><br/>
Who is this policy for?
<br/><br/>
This policy applies to all individuals working at all levels and grades, including senior managers, directors, colleagues (whether permanent, fixed-term or temporary), consultants, contractors, and any other persons providing services to Industrial Computer Contracts (West Midlands) Ltd.
<br/><br/>
What is a bribe?
<br/><br/>
A bribe is a financial or other advantage offered or given:
to anyone to persuade them to or reward them for performing their duties improperly or;
to any public official with the intention of influencing the official in the performance of his duties.
<br/><br/>
Gifts and Hospitality
<br/><br/>
This policy does not prohibit giving and receiving promotional gifts of low value and normal and appropriate hospitality. We will not provide gifts or hospitality with the intention of persuading anyone to act improperly or to influence a public official in the performance of his duties.
<br/><br/>
Facilitation payments and kickbacks
<br/><br/>
We do not make, and will not accept, facilitation payments or kickbacks of any kind. Kickbacks are typically payments made in return for a business favour or advantage. All colleagues must avoid any activity that might lead to, or suggest, that a facilitation payment or kickback will be made or accepted by us.
<br/><br/>
Donations
<br/><br/>
We do not make contributions of any kind to political parties. No charitable donations will be made for the purpose of gaining any commercial advantage.
<br/><br/>
Record Keeping
<br/><br/>
We will keep financial records and have appropriate internal controls in place which will evidence the business reason for making any payments to third parties.
All expense claims relating to hospitality, gifts or expenses incurred to third parties must be submitted in accordance with our expenses policy and specifically record the reason for the expenditure.
All accounts, invoices, memoranda and other documents and records relating to dealings with third parties, such as clients, suppliers and business contacts, must be prepared and maintained with strict accuracy and completeness. No accounts must be kept off-book to facilitate or conceal improper payments.
<br/><br/>
Raising Concerns
<br/><br/>
Colleagues will be encouraged to raise concerns about any issue or suspicion of malpractice at the earliest possible stage. No colleague will suffer any detriment as a result of raising genuine concerns about bribery, even if they turn out to be mistaken. If a colleague has a concern they wish to raise, they should contact the Finance Director, or, if there is a conflict, the Managing Director.
<br/><br/>
Monitoring and Review
<br/><br/>
This policy will be regularly be reviewed by the Board.
