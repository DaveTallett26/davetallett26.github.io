<br/>
If you have any question that I have not answered here then please <a href="email.html">mail me</a> and I will answer it personally.
<br/><br/>
This page is looking very dated in a coronavirus world, but I have saved it as a museum piece as most of it is still relevant. 
I can still use <a href="email.html">email</a>. 
<br/><br/>
Please <a href="email.html">mail me</a> for a Word copy of my CV. You can look at my
<a href="cv.html">CV page</a>
<br/><br/>
<b>Tallett is an unusual name, where did it come from?</b>
<br/><br/>
<a href="meaning.html">My best guess</a> is that it originated somewhere in the West of England. If you look up the word in some dictionaries the word tallett is an old English word meaning &quot;hayloft&quot; or barn.
<br/><br/>
<b>Could you send me an updated copy of your CV ?</b>
<br/><br/>
Please <a href="email.html">mail me</a> for a Word copy of my CV. You can look at my
<a href="cv.html">CV page</a>
<br/><br/>
<b>Can you supply two references ?</b>
<br/><br/>
I can supply references when a job offer is made.
<br/><br/>
<b>Do you do fixed price work ?</b>
<br/><br/>
As a rule, no.
<br/><br/>
<b>Do you work direct or through a recruitment agency ?</b>
<br/><br/>
With the introduction of IR35 across the private sector in 2021 I now look to work on PAYE Fixed Term Contracts only. 
  My limited company Industrial Computer Contracts (West Midlands) Ltd will be closed in 2021 after operating for 37 years in one form or another.
<br/><br/>
<b>When are you available for contract work ?</b>
<br/><br/>
I am always available for contract work if I can fit it in, <a href="email.html">mail me</a> me at for up to date information
<br/><br/>
<b>What rate are you willing to work for ?</b>
<br/><br/>
Round about 25GBP per hour is my normal rate.
<br/><br/>
<b>What sort of role will you consider ?</b>
<br/><br/>
I will consider anything legal and non fattening !
<br/><br/>
However, customers will be looking for a fit to their required skills. Over the last few
years I have worked as a programmer analyst which involves some program specification, some
programming and some testing. During my career I have worked as Project Leader, Business
Analyst, on HelpDesks, as a Systems Manager, DBA and Consultant. The market will decide!
<br/><br/>
In addition as you will see from <a href="cv.html">my CV</a> I only do Microsoft Access with Excel, SQL Server. 
I am not working on a contract at present but if the right requirement came along in the Midlands I would consider it - 
aiming to work on average 3 to 6 months in a year on site within commuting distance of B79 0NH. 
<br/><br/>
<b>Where are you willing to work ?</b>
<br/><br/>
The Midlands ie Birmingham, Nottingham, Derby, Coventry, Leicester within a 50 minute <a href="dcd.html">commute</a> of B79 0NH according to Google Maps
<br/><br/>
<b>When you work in the City where do you stay ?</b>
<br/><br/>
At home. I travel on the train every day from Birmingham. On one occasion my
commuting time was the same as people travelling to work from Ealing !
<br/><br/>
<b>What are your skills ?</b>
<br/><br/>
Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, Visual BASIC for Applications (VBA), SQL Server.
<br/><br/>
<b>What other skills do you have ?</b>
<br/><br/>
I could do Powerhouse on any platform. I could probably do COBOL on any platform, I have
done COBOL on VMS and Data General AOS/VS. I have done BASIC, FORTRAN and Pascal on VMS and
about 15 other flavours of BASIC at the last count including VB.NET. I am qualified as
a Microsoft Certified Professional on Windows 95 and 98 and on SQL Server 2000 and have MCAD in VB.NET.
Most recently I wrote a very simple Android Java app Cribbage Counter 
Have a look at my <a href="cv.html">CV</a>
<br/><br/>
<b>Do you know anybody with your skills who is available ?</b>
<br/><br/>
<a href="email.html">Mail me</a> and I will answer directly. When I first heard this question I always thought it was
a strange question to ask. As a contractor you move from one place to another and can not
generally keep in touch with people you work with from one job to another. The only people
fitting the bill are the people I am currently work with. Often I am the only one with my
skills where I work. From an agency point of view it is definitely worth asking the question
though. I have once or twice passed on leads to people who got the job eventually.
<br/><br/>
<b>Do you have any examples of your work ?</b>
<br/><br/>
I don't really go in for flashy software, to me the best <a href="simple.html">software</a> is easily understood and simple even if it may be long winded.
<br/><br/>
<a name="address"></a>
<b>What is your address ?</b>
<br/><br/>
The Hawthorns,<br/>
Hames Lane,<br/>
<a href="church.html">Newton Regis,</a><br/>
Tamworth,<br/>
Staffordshire.<br/>
B79 0NH<br/>
<br/><br/>
Follow this <a href="house.html">House</a> link to see a picture of where I live and see a
map of where it is.
<br/><br/>
<b>Do you hold a current UK Driving Licence ?</b>
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
<b>Marital Status ?</b>
