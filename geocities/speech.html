Welcome to my Brookes Talk Help Pages

<P>
I am happy to help with web page building and email problems for any user with the Brookes Talk speaking web browser.
<P>
This page is the entry to my Brookes Talk help pages. I will translate any of my pages or the GeoCities Help Pages into a form that Brookes Talk can easily read as some of the graphics on the GeoCities pages confuse Brookes Talk. 
<P>
I am sighted so please bear with me if I do not understand the problems of non-sighted people straight away. I have a copy of Brookes Talk on my computer and I am a GeoCities Community Leader.
