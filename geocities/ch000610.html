A W Tozer - The pursuit of God
<p>
A generation of Christians reared among push buttons and automatic machines is impatient of slower
and less direct methods of reaching their goals. We have been trying to apply machine-age methods 
to our relations with God. We read our chapter, have our short devotions, and rush away, hoping 
to make up for our deep inward bankruptcy by attending another gospel meeting or listening to 
another thrilling story told by a religious adventurer lately returned from afar. The tragic 
results of this spirit are all about us. Shallow lives, hollow religious philosophies, the 
preponderance of the element of fun in gospel meetings, the glorification of men, trust in 
religious externalities, quasi-religious fellowships, salesmanship methods, the mistaking 
of dynamic personality for the power of the Spirit; these and such as these are the symptoms 
of an evil disease, a deep and serious malady of the soul.
