<P>
I have 15 years experience as a <a href=http://www.labour.org.uk/>Labour Party</a> secretary (I have resigned this year, not because of <a href=http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Campus/2735/ir35/>IR35</a> but nobody believes me!) I have a good working relationship with my MP. Not only has <a href=http://members.tripod.co.uk/martin_tallett/index.htm>IR35</a> attacked my means of earning a living but it has set me against the Government I helped to elect.
<P>
I am committed to making PCG Ltd work, as one of the UK's first all electronic organisations, using my knowledge of running a widely dispersed constituency organisation (<a href=http://www.warwickshire.gov.uk/>North Warwickshire</a>). I have also been a <a href=http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Haven/2448/svclapp.html>GeoCities Community Leader</a>, part of an online help network.
<P>
I have been an agency contractor for 15 years mostly on <a href=http://www.digital.com/inFORM/issues/winter20/20sswi09.htm>VMS</a>, <a href=http://www.cognos.com/news/rel_223.html>Powerhouse</a> and COBOL, but lately on <a href=http://www.microsoft.com/Office/access/accesstour.htm>Microsoft Access</a> because I can work from <a href=http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Campus/2735/house.html>home</a>.
<P>
I am married with two children and although I have worked in France I have no plans to go offshore at the moment.
<P>
I was <a href=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds99/text/91013-28.htm#91013-28_spnew2>quoted</a> by Patrick Jenkin in the Lords debate on the WRB. I believe the judicial review will rightly wipe the floor with the Government. <a href=http://profiles.yahoo.com/martin_tallett>This</a> is my Yahoo! Profile. Thank you to everybody who seconded me.
