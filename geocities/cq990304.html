Modern civilization is so complex as to make the devotional 
life all but impossible.  It wears us out by multiplying 
distractions and beats us down destroying our solitude, where 
otherwise we might drink and renew our strength, before going 
out to face the world again.  "The thoughtful soul to solitude 
retires," said the poet of other and quieter times; but where 
is the solitude to which we can retire today?  "Commune with 
your own heart upon your bed and be still," is a wise and 
healing counsel; but how can it be followed in this day of the 
newspaper, the telephone, the radio and television?  These 
modern playthings, like pet tiger cubs, have grown so large and 
dangerous that they threaten to devour us all.  What was 
intended to be a blessing has become a positive curse.  No spot 
is now safe from the world's intrusion.  The need for solitude 
and quietness was never greater than it is today.  What the 
world will do about it is their problem.  Apparently the masses 
want it the way it is, and the majority of Christians are so 
completely conformed to this present age that they, too, want 
things the way they are.  They may be annoyed a bit by the 
clamor and by the goldfish-bowl existence they live, but 
apparently they are not annoyed enough to do anything about it.
