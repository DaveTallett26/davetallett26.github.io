I was going to sign up for Sainsbury's Orderline but the nice man at the Sunday Times beat me to it. Here's what happened when I signed up.
<p>
I rang the Orderline number, 0845 301 2020, during the morning and got an appointment the same day at lunch time when I normally do my weekly shop. Christina, my personal shopping assistant, bought me a cup of tea in the restaurant while she read me the Terms and Conditions for example the rules for substitution of products where Sainsbury's have no stock.
<p>
There were the usual demographic questions with a few interesting ones including "how many cats have you got". Sainsbury's want to understand the buying habits of ALL the family. Christina warned me it would take about two hours to scan the items in the store that I will be buying over the Internet. I couldn't really take that idea on until it was explained to me that the store, Marshall's Lake in Solihull, has about 12,000 items so you can't really have the whole of the store on your personal catalogue as I wanted. One of the conditions is that you have to be a Reward Card holder, no problem, fill in the form and the card is produced instantly.
<p>
You can either collect your shopping or have it delivered in the areas served by the store. Delivery is provided in 2 hour slots. For example delivery could be available in your area in three time slots on three different days of the week.
I was offered delivery between 7 and 9pm on Friday with no choice. The other slight catch is that the delivery van only takes 8 orders at a time so in my case if the van is full I suppose I have to wait until next week as the space on the van is allocated on a first come first served basis.
<p>
The next step was to create my personal catalogue by walking round the whole store and scanning in everything I was ever likely to buy (well nearly everything!) Christina said it would take two hours but I managed to get round in an hour, still too long for me, I was on my lunch break from work. It might be a good idea to take your last till receipt along with you or do your weekly shop at the same time as I suppose Sauinsbury's expected their customers to do. I was expecting to put a few items on to start with then add a few items a week but that idea got the thumbs down. It was a fascinationg experience going round the store just looking at products without actually buying anything. I would have spent a fortune on all the things we used to buy but for some reason we don't buy any more.
<p>
If you want to avoid this exercise then copy my catalogue, customer number 31611. The amusing part was when one of the customers asked if I was a Sainsbury's man. The basic reasion why you have to have a personal catalogue is so that you order when printed has as many items on it that the computer and therefore the pickers (Shoopers in Sainsbury's parlance) will know. Anything new that you add will just come up exactly as you type it so the pickers have to know what it is. Could the whole store catalogue be put onto a few web pages and indexed on Alta Vista? We could then type in "Sainsbury's Orderline coffee" and get all the coffee products available.
<p>
I am looking forward to getting it all going so that my teenage son can do our shopping from the settee in our front room using my HP Palmtop. The true potential of the Internet realised! Any questions have to be dealt with via the Orderline call centre. How I love these Internet facilities that only offer telephone support, no email addresses.
<p>
My personal catalogue is loaded to the Sainsbury's web site the next day. I can't wait to try it out. I will keep you posted here with the results.

Martin Tallett.
