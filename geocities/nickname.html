<FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Doc is my nickname, Doc is one of Snow White's seven dwarfs, hence the Doc graphic in the top left hand corner. </P>
<P>How did I get the nickname, apart from the fact that I have a PhD and therefore I AM Dr Tallett ? </P>
<P>It started when I worked at Pottertons where the Business Systems Manager Alan Alcock had a habit of saying he was going to consult Dr Tallett. </P>
<P>The footballers at Pottertons, particularly Barry Masters (Baz, the man with the biggest collection of flick knives in Blaken) then adopted the name Doc.</P>
<P>To cap it all I worked with Linda Robinson's Support Group which consisted of seven men and Linda so it was ideal for a Christmas competition where the rest of the department had to guess who was which dwarf if Linda was Snow White. I was Doc of course.</P>
<P>I'm a doctor, you can trust me!</P></FONT><HumanClick> <script language="javascript" src="http://hc2.humanclick.com/hc/x.js?cmd=file&file=chatScript&site=29540415"> </script> </HumanClick>
