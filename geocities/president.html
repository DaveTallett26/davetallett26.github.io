<p>            
By Mike Stuckey, MSNBC, March 24, 1999 5:34 AM PT 
<p>            
    A variety of candidates are using cyberspace in their 2000 
            presidential campaigns.
<p>            
    It's the volunteers, stupid. While graphic designers and code 
            cowboys vie to add the latest cyber bells and whistles to their 
            candidates' sites, the killer Web app for the 2000 presidential 
            campaign is recruiting and deploying your troops. 
            "Mobilizing supporters is the big advantage," says Michael 
            Cornfield, a political scientist at George Washington University in 
            Washington. "You need people to show up at those rallies -- you need 
            to pack those Iowa caucuses." 
            If the Web, which only made its debut in presidential politics in 
            the 1996 race, makes a difference in the 2000 election, Cornfield 
            and others say, it will be in how successfully it's used to drive 
            those supporters into action. 
            Aggressive showings online
            With that in mind, most of next year's White House hopefuls are 
            making early and aggressive showings on the Web.

            Smith also lack sites. 
<P>
            Perhaps the most successful gimmick so far was

Steve <u>F</u>orbes'
</a> 
 claim 
            that he was "the first in U.S. history" to kick off his campaign on 
            the Web. That bit of marketing garnered a publicity windfall for the 
            wealthy publisher, whom polls place in the middle of a crowded GOP 
            pack. 
<P>
            After 24 hours, traffic to the site, at just over 5 million visitors 
            (more than 5 percent of the popular vote in the 1996 election), was 
            "far surpassing expectations," said campaign press secretary 
            Juleanna Glover Weiss. Whether those visitors translate into votes 
            remains to be seen, but so far they have translated into 1,700 new 
            volunteers. 
<P>
            Like others, Forbes' site offers supporters various ways in which to 
            help the campaign. Volunteers can use an online form to commit to 
            everything from putting bumper stickers on their cars to leading a 
            Forbes "e-precinct," a kind of e-mail chain letter where the 
            supporter's stature grows with the number of others her or she 
            attracts to the campaign. Get 5,000 others to follow your "first 
            spark of patriotic activism" and you make the "e-National 
            Committee." 
<P>
            That's the key, says Carole Ann McKeown, who, as a California State 
            University graduate student, wrote an award-winning master's thesis 
            on candidates' use of the Web in 1996. 
            "You're not going to attract people to your site who aren't going to 
            vote for you," she points out, so you should focus your efforts on 
            organizing and motivating your partisans. 
<P>
            Use the Web to "keep those folks involved," echoes Lynn Reed, who 
            was the Clinton-Gore Web coordinator in 1996 and whose Washington, 
            D.C.-based Net Politics Group is handling Bill Bradley's Web site 
            for the 2000 race. 
<P>
            Reed says political uses of the Web are still clearly "evolving," 
            but one of the best she's found is merely collecting names and 
            addresses of supporters. In the first 3 1/2 months that Bradley's 
            site has been up, the campaign has gleaned the names of 11,000 
            potential volunteers. 
<P>
            No candidate offers a more immediate way for supporters to take 
            action than Republican Pat Buchanan, whose site exhorts an "Internet 
            Brigade" to undertake "Online Activism" via hyper links that click 
            right through to unscientific polls at other sites. "Let's get out 
            there and stand strong for Pat," users are urged. On Tuesday, the 
            call to arms was backed up with links to polls at Capitol Hill Blue 
            and America Online. 
<P>
            "My goal is to activate the brigade, to get them fired up and get 
            them going," says Linda Muller, Buchanan's Web site director. From 
            headquarters in McLean, Va., Muller updates the Buchanan site "all 
            day long, minute by minute," convinced that the Web's "instant 
            access on a global basis for us to get our message out" will play a 
            key role in her candidate's campaign. 
<P>
            Across the state in Charlottesville, University of Virginia 
            Professor Larry J. Sabato isn't so sure. 
            "I think it's almost a matter of keeping up with the Joneses. In the 
            long haul, 2000 is not going to be determined by the quality of the 
            Web site." 
<P>
            But Sabato believes that the Internet eventually will prove to be a 
            powerful force in American politics. One day, he predicts, we'll 
            actually use it to vote. In the meantime, some observers expect that 
            Web campaigning in the 2000 race won't be entirely positive. 
            However, George Washington's Cornfield points out, "The negative 
            uses of the Web are not going to go out under the names of the 
            official candidates." Campaigns will use "surrogate" sites to launch 
            their hit pieces, he believes. 
<P>
            And Reed says the Web provides a great opportunity for candidates to 
            criticize one another in legitimate ways. In a 1998 Washington state 
            House race, she produced a site that catalogued some 400 votes that 
            her candidate's opponent allegedly failed to make during his tenure 
            in the state legislature. 
 <p>
           Independent of her candidate's page, the "missedvotes.com" site was 
            referenced in television ads and "lended credibility to the 
            accusation," Reed said. And it won an award from a political 
            consultants trade group.
