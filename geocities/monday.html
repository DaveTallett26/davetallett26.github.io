Which day is the first day of the week ?
</font></center></table><hr><br><font face="arial"><font size=2>
<P>
More and more countries and organizations are caving in and making Monday
the de facto first day of the week.  I’m told that the calendars in France
have the days arranged on the page so that the first day is Monday.  Here
in Atlanta the cards that you buy to ride the subway for a week used to
start on Sunday; now they start on Monday.  Part of this is due to people’s
resentment at having the all-important weekend split between weeks.
<P>
There isn’t really a conflict between Christian and Jewish thinking as to
the numbering of the days of the week; the conflict concerns what day will
be called the Sabbath.  In strict Jewish observance, the Sabbath begins at
sundown on Friday and runs until sundown on Saturday.  Loosely, Saturday
was the Sabbath observed for centuries by Jews and Christians, because most
of the "daytime" of the Sabbath was on Saturday.
<p>
When Constantine became Roman Emperor in the 4th century A.D., the Christians
were becoming powerful.  Constantine announced his "conversion" to
Christianity, and even went so far as to decree that Christianity would be
the official religion of the Roman Empire.  But Constantine was a master
politician; he was really no more a Christian than Saddam Hussein, but he
saw the handwriting on the wall.  He knew that there were still powerful
pagan interests in the Empire, and he saw ways to reconcile pagan and
Christian camps.  By now the Christians were bishop-besotted and didn’t
care about the thrust of Jesus’ teaching; they just wanted power.  The
pagans wanted respect for their customs.  
<P>
Constantine lent his support to
making the birth of Jesus December 25; this was a sacred pagan ceremonial
date, the "re-birth of the Sun."  (There isn’t an ounce of evidence that
Jesus was born on December 25; most scholars opt for late spring or early
summer.)  
<P>
More substantially, Constantine colluded in making the first day
of the week the Christian Sabbath; Christians reasoned that it made sense
to honor the day on which Christ rose from the dead, the most important
occurrence in human history.  Pagans, however, were delighted because the
new Christian Sabbath was Sun-day, Dies Solis, the day sacred to Sol
Invictus, their chief god.  There isn’t a whit of Biblical support for
making Sunday the Sabbath but you have to sit on a Christian and twist
his arm to make him admit that!  
<P>
So strong now is this association that
many Christians believe that Sunday is the last day of the week, and hence
properly and righteously the Sabbath.  There are relatively small Christian
groups Seventh Day Adventists most notably that still insist on keeping
the Sabbath on Saturday, but they haven’t got much secular power.
<P>
The
signs on the street in my neighborhood say, "NO PARKING Except on Sunday"
(there is a church nearby) a probably illegal violation of church and
state separation, and in favor of the misinformed Sunday Sabbath-ers.  Some
tiny religious groups teach that there will be a terrible punishment for
pandering to the pagans and celebrating the Sabbath on Sunday; they even go
so far to say that Armageddon will be triggered by Sunday worship, and that
the Anti-Christ can be identified by his sponsorship of Sunday Sabbath.
Certainly the Catholic Church has been cozy with Sunday Sabbath for over
1500 years; its lack of Biblical support was no obstacle to a Church that
forbade the reading of the Bible by the laity in any case.
<P>
I’m not a Jew; I am a Christian but the Sabbath day issue is not violently
important to me.  However I hate to see dishonesty and ignorance in
something that is important to millions of people.
