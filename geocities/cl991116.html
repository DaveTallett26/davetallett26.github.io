<br><br>Carry a Notebook
<br><br>Two of the most powerful tools for<br>
overcoming the stresses of a busy life<br>
are a pen and a notepad. Write down<br>
your worries and watch them diminish.<BR>
Write down what you are going to<BR>
achieve in your day, and watch your<br>
tasks fall into order.
