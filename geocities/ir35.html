9 March 1999 - COUNTERING AVOIDANCE IN THE PROVISION OF PERSONAL SERVICES

<P>

The Chancellor announced today that changes are to be introduced to

counter avoidance in the area of personal service provision. This

move underlines the Government's commitment to achieving a tax system

under which everyone pays their fair share.

<P>

There has for some time been general concern about the hiring of

individuals through their own service companies so that they can

exploit the fiscal advantages offered by a corporate structure. It is

possible for someone to leave work as an employee on a Friday, only

to return the following Monday to do exactly the same job as an

indirectly engaged 'consultant' paying substantially reduced tax and

national insurance.

<P>

The Government is going to bring forward legislation to tackle this

sort of avoidance. The Inland Revenue will be discussing the

practical application of new legislation with interested parties and

will work with representative bodies on the production of guidance.

The new rules will take effect from April 2000.

<P>

1. The Government is committed to encouraging modern businesses which

develop and build on the strengths and commitment of their workforce.

The aim of the proposed changes is to ensure that people working in

what is, in effect, disguised employment will, in practice, pay the

same tax and national insurance as someone employed directly.

<P>

2. Businesses employing their workers directly say that they are

unable to compete with those encouraging the avoidance at which the

new legislation is aimed. As a result, ordinary workers can find they

are unable to compete for jobs with those willing to participate in

such arrangements. But those who do participate often have to pay a

price in terms of loss of protection under employment law. They may

find their terms and conditions altered - perhaps losing entitlement

to sick pay or maternity leave. They may even lose their jobs without

entitlement to notice or redundancy pay. They will usually have no

right to any claim for unfair dismissal and may lose their

entitlement to social security benefits through a failure to make

adequate contributions.

<P>

3. The proposed changes are aimed only at engagements with essential

characteristics of employment. They should affect only those cases

where these characteristics are disguised through use of an

intermediary - such as a service company or partnership. There is no

intention to redefine the existing boundary between employment and

self-employment.

<P>

4. Legislation is to be introduced to address the problem with effect

from April 2000. However, a primary concern is to minimise any impact

of these changes on ordinary businesses not involved in avoidance. To

this end, the Inland Revenue will over the next few months be working

with representative bodies on aspects of the practical application of

the new rules and on the production of guidance.<P>

<P>

These changes buttress the new measures to support small and medium

sized companies. Without the changes it would be very difficult to

target support at genuine entrepreneurial activity - making such

measures less effective and more costly.
