My mother's father was born and raised in England, and is a Tallett. His father spelled their last name Tallett, but my mother said his family came from France
<P>
His name was Charles Albert Tallett, and he was an ice sculpurist who worked at the Hotel Cecil in London until his premature death. He died of pneumonia around 1905. The Hotel Cecil was destroyed in the war.
<P>
His wife and mother then opened up a general store in London (1905-1911) where they sold produce and clothing. She then later took her sons, twins Albert and Charles, my grandfather, to Canada.
