<P>
The above URL is the reference to Hansard for the enabling legislation of IR35. The Treasury published it as an amendment to the Welfare Reform Bill last Thursday, 13th May 1999. There is no suggestion that it is delayed in coming into force until next April so I would say that it is not prudent for any contractor to work via a limited company as from now or for any agency to offer contractors working via a limited company. The result would be that the client would be assessed PAYE and NI on any payments which can be attributed to the individual contractors work.
<P>
Am I right? I would be interested in your opinion.
