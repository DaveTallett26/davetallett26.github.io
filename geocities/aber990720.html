If these proposals go through, there will be significant damage to the individuals, the <br>industry and the economy of the region in general".<br><br>PCG, a non-profit organisation representing contractors in the IT and engineering sectors is lobbying to <br>have the clauses overturned and a consultation procedure instituted to "tackle the real causes of abuse".<br>It maintains that about 300,000 businesses in the UK will be directly affected by the proposed <br>legislation.<br><br>The Government's proposals are aimed at clamping down on "disguised employment" where workers exploit the <br>"fiscal advantages offered by a corporate structure".<br><br>The "Friday-Monday" scenario is being targeted where a worker leaves full-time employment on a Friday and <br>the returns the following Monday as a consultant operating through a limited company, thereby paying less <br>tax and National Insurance.<br><br></b>
