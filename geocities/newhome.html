My name is Martin Tallett, and I'm a GeoCities Community Leader. As one of a many of Community Leaders, my job is to 
help new Homesteaders (that's you!) learn how to create great web pages and settle into their new 
neighborhoods.
<P>
If you're like most new Homesteaders, you're probably going to have a 
lot of questions. Never fear. I answer <a href=email.html>my email</a> within 24 hours.
<P>
If you are lucky I may be online right now. Find out at

Here's a list of places you can go for 
answers to some basic questions about building your new GeoCities 
homepage. 
<P>
You can find tutorials of all the programs GeoCities has to 
offer to get you on your way to building your own homepage with ease 
here at

<P>
Every neighborhood has its own main page.. That's where you can find 
out what's going on in SiliconValley, including contests, promotions 
and features. The main page also includes a directory of your 
neighbours' websites organized by topic or suburb
