A draughtsman has for some years been employed by an engineering firm. To reduce                his tax/NlCs liability and to reduce his employer's costs, the draughtsman's contract of                employment is terminated on 28 February and he is re-engaged on 1 March to do the same                work on similar terms via a personal service company. The draughtsman is subject to ongoing                control as to what tasks he undertakes and how they are carried out. This arrangement should                be caught by the new rules.                <P>2.      A doctor comes to work in the UK for two years. She is engaged by a private hospital                through a UK service company. The consultant in charge directs the doctor as to what work                she should do, has ultimate clinical responsibility for the patients and can supervise the doctor                in the performance of her duties. This arrangement should be caught by the new rules.                <P>3.      A rugby club engages a player through his own service company. If the engagement                had been direct the player would have been an employee. The club can control what the                player does e.g. they can say in which matches he plays and tell him what training sessions to                attend. This arrangement should be caught by the new rules.                <P>4.      A large road construction company hires 50 general labourers through a composite                service company. Each labourer pays an administration fee of £50 a year to an accountant                who administers the composite company. The construction company contracts with the                composite company for the provision of the 50 general labourers for a two year period. The                site manager employed by the construction company tells the general labourers exactly what                tasks have to be undertaken on a day to day basis and how. This arrangement should be                caught by the new rules.                <P>5.      A local council engages a firm of architects to design a new Civic Centre. Within the                terms of the contract the architects must provide three different designs within an overall                budget. There is a minimum requirement for office space, amenities, public areas etc. The                designs must be completed within a fixed time-scale. The contract details the work to be                carried out, timing, specification etc. These issues are agreed at the outset and the council do                not subsequently have the right to tell the firm what tasks are to be undertaken e.g. they                cannot tell them to design something different without amending the contract. Beyond the                contract specification, the Council has no control over how the firm carry out the work. The                new rules should not apply here.                <P>6.      A jeweller's shop engages a window cleaner to clean the shop windows twice a week                before opening time on a Wednesday and a Saturday morning. The window cleaner operates                through his own company. Here the initial agreement would specify exactly what was                required. Although payment would not be made for unsatisfactory work, there would be no                question of the shop owner telling the window cleaner how to clean the windows or telling                him, for example, to go and clean the windows at his home address instead. The new rules                should not apply here. <P>                7.    A large insurance company has set up a call centre to deal with its car insurance                 business. It engages an health consultant to give talks to all the call centre operators about                 back care and ergonomics. The consultant, who operates through her own company, is                 engaged to give 10 three hour workshops. The insurance company is relying on the                 consultant's expertise and cannot tell the consultant how to do the work. The contract                 specifies exactly what is to be done (i.e. 10 workshops) and the insurance company cannot tell                 the consultant to do something else instead (e.g. to provide treatment for those with existing                 back problems). The new rules should not apply here.       <P>          8.    A school hires a coach with driver from a local coach firm to take a class on a two                 week field trip. The provision of the driver is incidental to the hire of the coach. The new                 rules should not apply here.              <P>   9.    An IT engineer employed by a medium sized manufacturing company decides to 'go it                 alone' - leaving employment to set up his own IT consultancy. A few weeks later the former                 employer engages the consultant to undertake a millennium bug health check on all the                 company's computer systems. The consultant negotiates a fixed fee for providing a specified                 service to a pre-determined deadline. The company has no ongoing right of direction or                 control over what is done or how it is done. The new rules should not apply here.      <P>           10.   A travel company has had a new computer system installed. The company hires an IT                 consultant to supply additional technical support and training for staff in the use of the new                 system. The consultant is taken on for a period of three months to undertake tasks as directed                 on a day by day basis by the IT manager. The new rules should apply here.                 <P>11.   The 'head chef' at a small hotel is engaged through her own personal service company.                 The hotel cannot tell the chef 'how' to cook the food but it is able to veto menus suggested by                 the chef and can, for example, tell her to lay on a special buffet on a particular day, arrange a                 special themed menu for a particular night or produce special children's meals for a particular                 group of guests. The arrangement should be caught by the new rules.     <P>            12.   A vet in partnership spends every Monday working at the local zoo attending various                 animals as required by their keepers and undertaking other duties (e.g. performing post-                 mortems, preparing animals for transit, supervising inseminations and providing training on                 various animal health matters) as directed by the head-keeper. The zoo pays the partnership                 an annual fee for the vets attendance each Monday. This engagement should be caught by the                 new rules. However, members of the partnership are sometimes requested to attend animals at                 other times - for example, when one injures itself in the middle of the night. Such visits are                 outside the terms of the annual contract and a fee is charged appropriate to the work done.                 On these occasions the zoo has no right of direction or control over what is done or how it is                 done. The zoo may reject advice given or refuse treatment recommended but this would not                 amount to a right of direction or control. In these cases the new rules should not apply. <IMG SRC="http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=76000007&t=931698077" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=1>
