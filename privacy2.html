<br/><br/>Analytics – eg how visitors use our website
<br/>We do use Google Analytics but not throughout the website. We use it for general website management.
<br/>Google Analytics is a third-party information storage system that records information about the pages you visit, 
the length of time you were on specific pages and the website in general, how you arrived at the site and what you clicked on when you were there. 
You can view the Google privacy policy below:
<br/>Google - http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

<br/><br/>Do we log IP addresses?
<br/>An IP or Internet Protocol Address is a unique numerical address assigned to a computer as it logs on to the internet. 
Industrial Computer Contracts (West Midlands) Ltd. does not use your IP address or any related personal identifiable information. 
Your IP address is logged when visiting our site by our hosting provider UK2.

<br/><br/>How will we use the information about you and why?
<br/>At Industrial Computer Contracts (West Midlands) Ltd we take your privacy seriously 
and will only use your personal information to provide the Services you have requested from us, 
detailed in our Terms and Conditions and as we have identified above. 
We will only use this information subject to your instructions, data protection law and our duty of confidentiality.

<br/><br/>For Business to Business Clients and Contacts our lawful reason for processing your personal information will be “legitimate interests”. 
Under “legitimate interests” we can process your personal information if we have a genuine and legitimate reason and we are not harming any of your rights and interests.

<br/><br/>For Business to Consumer Clients and Contacts our lawful reason for processing your personal information will be “A contract with the individual” 
eg to supply goods and services you have requested, or to fulfil obligations under an employment contract. 
This also includes steps taken at your request before entering into a formal contract.

<br/><br/>We may receive personal data from you for the purposes of our money laundering checks, such as a copy of your passport. 
This data will only be processed for the purposes of preventing money laundering and terrorist financing, or as otherwise permitted by law and with your express consent.

<br/>Our work for you may require us to pass your information to our third-party service providers, agents, subcontractors and other associated organisations 
for the purposes of completing tasks and providing the Services to you on our behalf. However, when we use third party service providers, 
we disclose only the personal information that is necessary to deliver the Services 
but we are governed by their privacy statements which we consider when selecting them as a supplier. 
We will not share your information for marketing purposes.

<br/><br/>Transferring your information outside of the United Kingdom
<br/>As part of the services offered to you through this website, the information which you give to us may be transferred to countries outside the United Kingdom (“UK”). 
For example, some of our third-party providers such as Microsoft and HP may be located outside of the UK. 
Where this is the case we will consider what security measures are taken so that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this policy. 
By submitting your personal data, you’re agreeing to this transfer, storing or processing. 
Where our third-party suppliers are in the US we expect that their services are deemed to have adequate protection 
and therefore facilitate the transfer of information from the UK to the US.

<br/><br/>Transferring your information outside of the UK, US and EU.
<br/>In the EU this is known as a third country transfer. For example Australia is a third country with respect to data protection and privacy laws.
Some of our customers may be based in Australia.
Where this is the case we will consider what security measures are taken so that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this policy. 
By submitting your personal data, you’re agreeing to this transfer, storing or processing. 
Where our customers are in Australia we expect that their personal data protection will be covered by contract clauses 
which meet the standards set out in the UK Data Protection Act 2018.

<br/><br/>Data protection in Australia
<br/>There is no registration requirement in Australia for data controllers or data processing activities. 
Under the Privacy Act, organizations are not required to notify the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of any processing of personal information. 
Organizations are not required to appoint a data protection officer.

<br/><br/>Does Australia have privacy laws?
<br/>There is no statutory definition of privacy in Australia. The Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) was given a reference to review Australian privacy law in 2006. (Wikipedia)

<br/><br/>If you use our services while you are outside the UK, your information may be transferred outside the UK to give you those services.

<br/><br/>Security precautions in place about data collected
<br/>When you give us personal information, we take steps to make sure that it’s treated securely. When you are on a secure page, 
a lock icon will appear in web browsers such as Apple Safari. Non-sensitive details (your email address etc.) are sent over the Internet when using email, 
and this can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, 
we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 
Once we receive your information, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. 
Where we have given (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. 
We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

<br/><br/>Credit Risk Profiling
<br/>We may also use your personal information to detect and cut fraud and credit risk. 
We may make use of extra information about you when it is available from external sources to help us do this effectively.

<br/><br/>Objections to processing of personal data
<br/>It is your right to lodge an objection to the processing of your personal data if you feel the “grounds relating to your particular situation” apply.

<br/><br/>Data Portability
