Although I am David Martin Tallett I have always gone by the name Martin. However when I worked at Asda I went by the name Dave. 
Strange as it may seem this was my bosses idea, and it works a treat! 
The problem was that everything is systems based at Asda and people were always looking at their computer screens for the name David Tallett and not finding it 
so I felt I was being overlooked for work.
<br/><br/>
When you apply for a job the online application form asks for First Name and Last Name so I started off as David in my job interviews. 
For the first interview I tried to correct Karen but on the second occasion when I was interviewed by Maureen I gave up!
<br/><br/>
There is also a health and safety implication - if I was in a road accident and perhaps unconcious I want the paramedics to get the right name. 
The NHS have always known me as David and so have HMRC and most Government departments that I have ever had dealings with. 
Most importantly my passport and the electoral register used by credit reference agencies and employment agencies as a first reference point have me as David.
<br/><br/>
Nowadays the banks are fairly strict too. My late Mum used to write me cheques as Martin Tallett and the bank refused to cash them!
<br/><br/>
Online just call me Dave (<a href="meaning.html">Tallett</a>)
