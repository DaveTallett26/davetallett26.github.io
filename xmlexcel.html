Using XML to move data around has always appealled to me as a method which avoids the pitfalls of files of comma separated values and tab delimited files. No line of headings is required so your data always transfers from one system to the next faithfully represented. It never semms to have got off the ground in small scale systems at least, although Access will make a stab at outputting useful XML data it still ends up being overly complex if an XSD schema is required.

Excel and XML seems to be more difficult than it needs to be to get started and ends up not being a great deal of use, CSV files are always good enough. If you absolutely must have XML for some reason then these links may help you. Here is a very simple <a href="xmlsample.html">XML</a> file and a hand written <a href="xsdsample.html">XSD</a> to go with it, with VBA code to output the data on a worksheet to an XML file with no XSD required.
