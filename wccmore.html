I assisted Council staff in a data cleansing exercise moving special needs educational data from several disparate MS Access, MS Excel and packaged solutions into a new packaged solution for the administration of Special Educational Needs - Synergy. The work involved data validation and cleansing of data using a number of common sense rules and external reference sources to validate the data. Multiple transfers were made either automatically or in many cases manually. Due to the content of the data a good deal of reasoned judgement was required. Two OFSTED annual survey returns were completed using the cleansed data.

The contract was terminated early due to the blanket introduction of the IR35 rules in the public sector in April 2017
