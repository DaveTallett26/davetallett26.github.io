The wearing of a prayer shawl is mentioned in The Bible, Numbers 15:38
<br/><br/>
<i>
38 Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, 
and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue:
<br/>
39 And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them ; 
and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:
<br/>
40 That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.
</i>
<br /><br/>
The tallit katan (Yiddish/Ashkenazic Hebrew tallis koton; "small tallit") is a fringed garment traditionally worn either under or over one's clothing by Jewish males. 
It is a poncho-like garment with a hole for the head and special twined and knotted fringes known as tzitzit attached to its four corners.
<br /><br/>
Each tassel has eight threads (when doubled over) and five sets of knots, totaling 13. The sum of all numbers is 613, 
traditionally the number of commandments in the Torah. 
This reflects the concept that donning a garment with tzitzyot reminds its wearer of all Torah commandments, as specified in Numbers 15:39
