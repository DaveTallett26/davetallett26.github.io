Working for the well-respected Bell International Language School in Cambridge, I worked as a temporary SQL Server DBA and information analyst shadowing the organisations existing DBA who was leaving. I then introduced the replacement DBA to the language school and supported him during a two week induction. The technologies involved were SQL Server 2000, 2005 and 2008 with both log shipped and mirrored configurations, Sharepoint and Excel VBA reporting. Each year Bell International Langage Schools help over 100,000 students, from more than 120 countries learn English through one of 37 worldwide teaching centres and e-channels.
