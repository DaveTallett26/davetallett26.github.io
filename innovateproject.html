With one other person I supported a busy haulage and coldstore depot which ran approximately 75 PCs. We were responsible for all aspects of IT provision from the telephone exchange and networking to the Access database programs and a classic ASP website. In addition there was a great deal of interaction with a bespoke haulage package running on an IBM iSeries machine including liaison with the third party support for this package. Specifically I supported Windows XP, Office, Microsoft Access and Excel VBA, VB.NET and classic ASP.
