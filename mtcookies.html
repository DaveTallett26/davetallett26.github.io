On 26th May 2012 the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/cookies-and-similar-technologies/">EU Directive on cookies</a> came into force in the UK.
</br></br>
The two pages <a href="cookies.html">Cookies</a> and <a href="disablecookies.html">Disabling Cookies</a> are taken from FT.com and provide a good description of how cookies are used on a major website and how to disable them should you so wish.

I found Avinash Kaushik's <a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/eu-cookie-privacy-law-data-analysis-collection/">blog</a> useful in understanding the background to cookies and their uses.
