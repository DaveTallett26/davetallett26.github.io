<br/><br/>
Industrial Computer Contracts (West Midlands) Limited recognises that complying with the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (and regulations made under it) is a legal requirement, not a matter of choice.
<br/><br/>
Our policy is to exceed the minimum requirements of the law where possible and to do this we will provide sufficient resources to meet this commitment. We will also ensure that systems are in place that will allow us to maintain, monitor and, where necessary, improve safety performance. Included in these systems will be means to allow communication and consultation on health and safety matters between all levels of the business.
<br/><br/>
In return, the Company expects employees at all levels to exceed their minimum legal duties, which are described in our organisational responsibilities. This includes co-operating with us on safety matters and taking care of their own safety and that of others, whether from within the company or from outside, who may be affected by their actions.
<br/><br/>
Any information, instruction, training or supervision necessary to meet these commitments will be provided to those who require it in order to perform their job safely.
<br/><br/>
The policy and the way it has operated will be reviewed at least annually and more often if the business changes in nature or size. Any revision necessary to improve safety performance will be made and then reported to employees.
