I worked delivering groceries to Asda online customers in Coventry, Bedworth, Nuneaton and Kenilworth. I was required to deliver to a demanding timed schedule giving excellent customer service at all times as Asda's representative on the doorstep. I also worked as a Shop Floor Assistant over the Christmas period in the Beer, Wine and Spirits department at Asda Tamworth
<br/><br/>
This job was a complete departure from my normal work and I feel it gave me a much more rounded insight into what is required in today's fast moving retail environment. I intended it as a part time role but Asda are a very demanding employer and wanted too much of my time. I am now looking to move back into IT related work at any level.
