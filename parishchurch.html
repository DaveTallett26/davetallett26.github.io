St. Mary's Church was built some 600 years ago on the site of an earlier church. Its slender and well proportioned spire dominates the village scene.
<br><br>
Entry into the Church is through a handsome medieval porch - probable date 15th century - its unusual feature being the vaulted stone roof. The interior is spacious and light, only a few fragments of the ancient colured glass surviving, notably in the east window where there is a small 14th century shield bearing the three leopards of England.
<br><br>
The Chancel was rebuilt c1320, the nave c1330 - c1340 when the west tower was remodelled and heightened and topped by a spire. In the north recess of the chancel is laid a tapering slab or coffin lid carved in low relief, with the figure of a priest in vestments.
<br><br>
At the angle of the north wall is an ancient diagonal buttress in which is cut a plain rectangular squint looking towards the altar, possibly also serving as a leper squint.
<br><br>
In 1291 the church was valued at VIII marks.
<br><br>
The Communion Plate includes a silver paten and chalice of 1731 and a larger paten of 1760.
<br><br>
Church registers were kept from 1591.
<br><br>
There are <a href="http://www.warksbells.co.uk/index.php/m-o/newton-regis">three bells</a> - the treble, which includes parts of an old bell found in the Rectory gardens, was cast in 1931,
the second in 1602 and the tenor in 1642.
<br><br>
The whole building was restored internally in 1905 and externally in 1908. Very recently the entire roof of the nave was releaded and the tower and spire were repaired. It is hoped that further restoration needed will be carried out in the near future.
