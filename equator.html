My CV link to the AXA PPP healthcare website has drawn the attention of an SEO consultancy,
<a href="http://www.eqtr.com/services/search-engine-optimisation/">Equator</a>.<br/><br/>
 I had a polite email from them ...

<pre>

I am contacting you on behalf of my client AXA PPP healthcare. We
are acting as digital marketing consultants, working closely with
their eBusiness team and coordinating with the eBusiness team
senior manager.

We are trying to remove some backlinks pointing to their website.
While I understand that you have linked to my client in good faith,
we would really appreciate your help in removing the links
highlighted to enable them to comply with Google's webmaster
guidelines

On their advice I implemented a nofollow link which hopefully has improved their search engine ranking.

Links to an unendorsed document, like a paid link, "nofollow" is used by Google, to specify that the Google search spider should not follow that link

My first steps in Search Engine Optimisation!
