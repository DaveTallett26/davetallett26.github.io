If you have any question that I have not answered here then please <a 
href="email.html">mail me</a> and I will answer it personally.
<p>
<a name="available"></a>
<b>When are you available for contract work ?</b>
<p>
Immediately
<p>
<a name="rate"></a>
<b>What rate are you willing to work for ?</b>
<p>
How long is a piece of string ! 
<p>
Generally it depends on the location and the technical environment. I am based in the West Midlands. I will consider other locations including the City of London.
<p>
<a name="role"></a>
<b>What sort of role will you consider ?</b>
<p>
I will consider anything legal and non fattening !
<p>
However, customers will be looking for a fit to their required skills. Over the last few 
years I have worked as a programmer analyst which involves some program specification, some 
programming and some testing. During my career I have worked as Project Leader, Business 
Analyst, on HelpDesks, as a Systems Manager and Consultant. The market will decide!
<p>
<a name="permanent"></a>
<b>Would you consider a permanent position ?</b>
<p>
I will consider anything!
<p>
<a name="where"></a>
<b>Where are you willing to work ?</b>
<p>
The Midlands ie Birmingham, Nottingham.<br>
The City of London ie within 6 tube stops of Euston.<br>
I will consider working anywhere in the UK and Europe at present.
<br>
<p>
<a name="stay"></a>
<b>When you work in the City where do you stay ?</b>
<p>
At home. I travel on the train every day from Birmingham. On one occasion my 
commuting time was the same as people travelling to work from Ealing !
<p>
<a name="skills"></a>
<b>What are your skills ?</b>
<p>
Microsoft Access, Visual BASIC, Powerhouse, COBOL, VMS and UNIX.
<p>
<a name="other_skills"></a>
<b>What other skills do you have ?</b>
<p>
I could do Powerhouse on any platform. I could probably do COBOL on any platform, I have 
done COBOL on VMS and Data General AOS/VS. I have done BASIC, FORTRAN and Pascal on VMS and 
about 15 other flavours of BASIC at the last count including Visual BASIC. I am qualified as 
a Microsoft Certified Professional on Windows 95 and 98.
<p>
<a name="anybody"></a>
<b>Do you know anybody with your skills who is available ?</b>
<p>
<a href=email.html>Mail me</a> and I will answer directly. When I first heard this question I always thought it was 
a strange question to ask. As a contractor you move from one place to another and can not 
generally keep in touch with people you work with from one job to another. The only people 
fitting the bill are the people I am currently work with. Often I am the only one with my 
skills where I work. From an agency point of view it is definitely worth asking the question 
though. I have once or twice passed on leads to people who got the job eventually.
<p>
<a name="address"></a>
<b>What is your address ?</b>
<p>
The Hawthorns,<br>
Hames Lane,<br>
Newton Regis,<br>
